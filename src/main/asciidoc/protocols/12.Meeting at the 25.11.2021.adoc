== Current Status
The branch Develop has been created and also has been merged with the branch main quite regularly, some problems with the basis functionalities have been founded and hopefully they are going to be solved till next meeting, the class diagramms need to be updated with the current classes that each of us have , and also some problems with it need to be solved. Since now we haven’t 
which role can actually modify the basis functionalities of each class, and for that reason each role needs to have its each GUI. Each one is responsible of the test cases of its own classes and also some issues have been resolved ( this one is going to be edited till next meeting).Right now each of us is really busy with his each basis functionalities. Since we have not faced any problems.
