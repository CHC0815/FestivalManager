== Current Status
We are still coding in the branch Developer, all the basis functionalities have been done and also most of the muss criteria, which only one thing is missing, 
in the following weeks we need to see the edge cases of each package, and try to solve them as well as start testing the code, we are really cautious of the code smells 
and we try to avoid them / fixe them every single time that we have the possibility. Some little text.adoc needs to be prepared for the cross testing, thing that will be done
till this sunday. We are also aware of the mid- term presentation this week , and for those reasons we have prepared for this thing.
